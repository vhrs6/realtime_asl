# Project Description

This project appears to be a collection of files related to an application that involves hand tracking, translation, and text-to-speech functionality.

## Files

- `about.html`: An HTML file, likely containing information about the project.
- `asl_backend.py`: A Python file, possibly the backend logic for American Sign Language (ASL) related functionality.
- `asl_model.h5`: A model file, likely a trained model for ASL recognition.
- `backend.py`: A Python file, likely containing the main backend logic.
- `hand_tracker.py`: A Python file, likely containing code for tracking hand movements.
- `image.png`, `img.jpg`, `img.png`: Image files.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file, likely containing client-side logic.
- `style.css`: A CSS file, likely containing styling information.
- `test_fetch.html`: An HTML file, possibly for testing purposes.
- `translator.html`: An HTML file, likely related to translation functionality.
- `tts_backend.py`: A Python file, likely the backend logic for text-to-speech (TTS) functionality.
- `static_audio/`: A directory containing static audio files.
- `static_audio_tts_service/`: A directory containing static audio files generated by a TTS service.

## Summary

Based on the file names, this project seems to be a web application that uses hand tracking to recognize American Sign Language, translate it, and provide text-to-speech output.

## How it Works

1.  The `hand_tracker.py` script likely captures hand movements.
2.  The `asl_model.h5` model, used by `asl_backend.py`, recognizes the hand gestures as American Sign Language.
3.  The recognized ASL is then translated using the `translator.html` and related scripts.
4.  Finally, the translated text is converted to speech using the `tts_backend.py` script, and the audio is stored in the `static_audio/` or `static_audio_tts_service/` directories.
5.  The `index.html` file likely serves as the main interface, displaying the hand tracking, translation, and providing audio output.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries.

## Usage

1.  Run the backend server.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
